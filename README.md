### Introduction

This is the course project for the Practical Machine Learning Coursera course in the Data Science Specialization. We use data from fitness trackers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of six participants who were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in five different ways. We train a classification model with this 5-level factor variable as the target and apply the model on a new set of data. Here, random forest and gradient boosting models are trained.

### Data 

The data are obtained from: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har

### Main Output
The analysis is hosted at: http://eideal.github.io/PMLCourseProject/PML_CourseProject.html

The problem_id_* files were the classification results for 20 test samples and were used for coursera assignment submission.
